    <h3>Who We Are</h3>
    <p>
      Robopanda Robotic & Coding is a learning platform focused on introducing
      robotics and coding through logic, creativity, and play.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that understanding systems should start simple —
      through exploration, experimentation, and meaningful projects.
